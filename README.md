### “Using AI Systems to Detect Problem Gamblers in Online Gaming” by Luke Pullicino, Dr Joel Azzopardi, Dr Christopher Zerafa
MSc dissertation for MSc AI. This MSc dissertation introduces DOUSE, an innovative system that leverages artificial intelligence to predict potential self-exclusion among online gamblers. The research is particularly timely as the gambling industry increasingly adopts AI technologies for player monitoring and safety.

The system combines machine learning prediction models with an eXplainable AI (XAI) framework, addressing a critical need in the industry for transparent decision-making when identifying at-risk players. By incorporating player safety analysts (PSAs) in a feedback loop, DOUSE creates a human-in-the-loop approach that continuously refines the system's accuracy.

This work aligns with current industry trends where companies are developing AI systems to identify problem gambling behaviours through pattern recognition. Similar to Mindway AI's color-coded risk assessment system and Optimove's risk-rating approach, DOUSE aims to detect concerning patterns before they escalate into harmful gambling behaviours.

The research addresses the ethical challenges highlighted in recent discussions about AI in gambling, balancing player protection with privacy concerns. By focusing on early intervention through self-exclusion prediction, this work contributes to the growing field of responsible gambling technologies that can help operators fulfill their social responsibility obligations.

### “Player Activity Clustering and Anomaly Detection” by Calvin Micallef, Dr Charlie Abela, Dr Christopher Zerafa
BSc dissertation for BSc AI focusing on developing a system for detecting anomalous player behaviour in the iGaming industry using graph-based anomaly detection techniques. The research implemented and compared five state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection models to identify unusual patterns in player activity. Working with a real-life dataset containing over 24 million data points, we transformed this into a graph structure with over 34,000 nodes. The system successfully identified over 15,000 anomalies across all models, with 2,171 anomalous players detected. The AdONE model detected the fewest anomalies (1,284), while the CoLA model identified the most (5,665). The results were presented through a web application for easy visualisation and understanding. This work contributes to the growing field of graph-based anomaly detection with practical applications in the iGaming sector for identifying potentially problematic user behaviour.

### “Developing next-generation feature store in real-time streaming big data environment” by Amadeusz Horzyk, Dr Charlie Abela, Dr Christopher Zerafa
Industry placement for MSc AI focusing on developing an advanced feature store optimised for real-time analytics in streaming data environments. This involved exploring innovative approaches to feature engineering workflows, addressing challenges in data ingestion, processing, and storage of high-volume streaming data. The research aimed to create a unified solution that enables low-latency access to features for machine learning inference while maintaining data consistency. By leveraging technologies such as Apache Kafka, the project resulted in a solution which enabled efficient real-time decision-making systems across various applications such as fraud detection, personalised recommendations, and monitoring systems.

### “Developing a reconciliation framework across multiple data platforms” by Luke Pullicino, Mark Tanti, Dr Christopher Zerafa
Industry placement for MSc AI involving the creation of a tool system to compare and align data from different database sources. This framework included capabilities for:
- Defining reconciliation workflows between data sources and targets
- Connecting to multiple databases via JDBC to execute SQL queries
- Implementing reporting, monitoring, and alert notification features
- Using SQL templating for dynamic value replacement
- Comparing datasets and identifying discrepancies

The project was crucial for GiG to ensure data consistency across various platforms and systems.

### “Petrophysical Study of the F3 Block within the Dutch Sector of the North Sea” by Bernard Pisani, Dr. Godwin Debono, Dr Christopher Zerafa
MSc dissertation for MSc Geosciences focusing on analysing the petrophysical properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the F3 Block of the Dutch sector of the North Sea. This area has been extensively studied for oil and gas exploration, with available 3D seismic data and information from several wells, including F02-1, F03-1, F03-2, F03-4, and F06-1. The study incorporated well log data (sonic, gamma, and density logs) to evaluate reservoir characteristics and potential hydrocarbon accumulation zones. The research employed various analytical techniques to characterise lithology, identify reservoir units, and potentially predict properties of porosity and permeability in areas between wells. This work contributed to the broader understanding of the subsurface geology and petroleum systems in this region of the North Sea.
